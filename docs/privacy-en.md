# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2024-09-11

This privacy policy describes how the browser extension (hereafter referred to as "the Extension") handles data collected and processed. We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring the security of the data managed locally.

### Data Collection

The Extension does not collect, store, or process any personal data of the user. The only information collected relates to the academic questionnaires you access while using the Extension. These questionnaires are stored locally in your browser and are not transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.

### Data Storage

All information related to the academic questionnaires collected by the Extension resides exclusively in your browser. We do not have access to this data, and it is not shared with any external entities. The Extension does not store information on remote servers, nor does it use cloud services for data processing.

### Data Deletion

You have the ability to delete the stored questionnaires at any time directly from the Extensionâ€™s settings. Once deleted, the data is permanently removed from your browser and cannot be recovered.

### Data Security

The responsibility for ensuring the security of these data rests with the user. It is strongly recommended to take additional measures to protect your system, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating your browser, and employing appropriate security software.

### Disclaimer

The use of the Extension is at your own risk. The Extension is provided "as is," without any explicit or implied warranties regarding its performance or the security of the data stored locally. The development team is not responsible for any damage or loss arising from the use of the Extension, including data loss.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. If changes are made, we will update the date of the last version. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed of any updates.
